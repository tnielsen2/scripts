## aws-volume-tagging.txt

This script is used to pull down all AWS volumes that are tagged with a "Production-A", and then apply "Snapshots:True" for use with the AWS Snapshot Lifecycle manager in the EC2 console.

Replace the necessary tagging to fit your needs.  Also in this file is the slightly modified script for a Jenkins job.
